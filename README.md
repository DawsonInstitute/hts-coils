### MyBinder Build Optimization

**Optimized Docker Architecture for Fast Builds:**

This repository uses a two-stage Docker approach for MyBinder to dramatically reduce build times:

1. **Base Image** (`Dockerfile.base`): Contains all heavy dependencies (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter, etc.)
   - Pushed to GitHub Container Registry: `ghcr.io/dawsoninstitute/hts-coils-base:latest`
   - Build time: ~5-10 minutes (one-time, cached by GHCR)
   - Rarely changes, providing stable cached layer

2. **MyBinder Image** (`Dockerfile.mybinder`): Extends base image with repository code
   - Only copies code changes (lightweight layer)
   - Build time: ~1-2 minutes (after base image is cached)
   - Updates automatically with each code commit

**Note:** The first time MyBinder builds from a new base image, it will take longer (~5-10 minutes) as it pulls and caches the base image. Subsequent builds should be much faster (~1-2 minutes). If you're seeing long build times, the base image may still be propagating through MyBinder's cache system.

**Benefits:**
- **10x faster builds** after initial base image creation
- **Reduced resource usage** on MyBinder infrastructure
- **Better user experience** with minimal wait times
- **Environmentally friendly** through cached layer reuse

**Technical Details:**
```dockerfile
# Base image (cached)
FROM buildpack-deps:jammy
RUN pip install numpy scipy matplotlib jupyter ...

# MyBinder image (updated frequently)  
FROM ghcr.io/dawsoninstitute/hts-coils-base:latest
COPY . /home/jovyan/hts-coils
RUN pip install -e .
```

See `Dockerfile.base` and `Dockerfile.mybinder` for complete implementation.

## Installation

### Basic Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DawsonInstitute/hts-coils.git
cd hts-coils
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Optional FEA Dependencies

For finite element analysis, you can use the open-source FEniCSx solver or the commercial COMSOL Multiphysics software.

- **FEniCSx (Recommended)**: A powerful open-source library for solving partial differential equations. Requires Conda for installation (see below).
- **COMSOL Multiphysics**: A commercial package that requires:
  - Separate installation and license
  - COMSOL server running on port 2036
  - Required modules: AC/DC Module, Plasma Module
  - Python client connects via `mph` library to localhost:2036

### Development Installation

**Complete development setup with virtual environment:**

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/DawsonInstitute/hts-coils.git
cd hts-coils

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install package in editable mode (required for tests)
pip install -e .

# Optional: Install JAX with CUDA support for GPU acceleration
# This step eliminates "CUDA-enabled jaxlib not installed" warnings during validation
# If you don't have a CUDA-compatible GPU, skip this step - the framework runs fine on CPU
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda12]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html

# Note: FEA dependencies (fenics-dolfinx) require Conda and cannot be installed via pip in venv
# See "Optional: FEniCSx Installation" section below for FEA setup

# Initialize submodules for advanced optimizations (optional)
# This downloads the warp-bubble-optimizer submodule which contains core optimization algorithms
# The 'S' status marker in git indicates "Submodule" - it tracks a specific commit reference
# Files in submodules cannot be directly staged in the parent repository (use 'cd optimizer/' to commit changes)
# Note: You may see "Using core optimization modules" message - this is normal as advanced mission/validation
# features are not yet integrated. The core optimization functions (power.py) are sufficient for HTS design.
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Run validation tests
python scripts/validate_environment.py
pytest tests/ -v

# Install in development mode (optional)
pip install -e .[opt]  # Includes Bayesian optimizer (scikit-optimize)
```

### Optional: FEniCSx Installation

For full finite element analysis capabilities, install FEniCSx:

```bash
# Option 1: Conda (recommended for FEniCSx)
conda create -n fenics python=3.11
conda activate fenics
conda install -c conda-forge fenics-dolfinx mpich pyvista

# Optional: Add GPU support for FEniCSx in Conda (only if you have NVIDIA GPU and want GPU acceleration)
# Skip this if you don't have a CUDA-compatible GPU or only need CPU mode
conda install cuda-cudart cuda-version=12

# Option 2: Docker (most reliable - use the official FEniCSx image)
# Note: Our ghcr.io/dawsoninstitute/hts-coils-base:latest image is for MyBinder optimization only
# For local FEniCSx work, use the official dolfinx image:
docker pull dolfinx/dolfinx:stable

# Run an interactive FEniCSx environment with your code mounted
docker run -ti -v $(pwd):/home/fenics/shared dolfinx/dolfinx:stable

# Inside the container, navigate to your code and run:
# cd /home/fenics/shared
# python -m src.warp.fenics_plasma
# Or start a Jupyter notebook server:
# jupyter notebook --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root

# Option 3: pip (may require system dependencies)
pip install fenics-dolfinx[all]
```

**Quick validation check:**
```bash
# Test core functionality (CPU mode)
python -m src.warp.comsol_plasma  # Uses analytical approximations
python -m src.warp.fenics_plasma  # Requires FEniCSx installation

# Run comprehensive validation
pytest tests/ --tb=short
# Expected: 11 passed, 11 skipped (high-field modules require hts.high_field_scaling package)
```

**Note on GPU Detection:**
If you see "No GPU devices found" warnings during validation despite installing JAX with CUDA support, this indicates one of the following:
- Your system doesn't have a CUDA-compatible NVIDIA GPU
- CUDA drivers are not properly installed
- JAX cannot detect the GPU (driver/library mismatch)
- **WSL2 users**: GPU passthrough requires additional setup (see below)

The framework operates correctly in CPU-only mode with no loss of functionality, only reduced performance for large-scale simulations. GPU acceleration is optional and primarily benefits intensive numerical computations in the plasma simulation modules.

**WSL2 GPU Setup (for NVIDIA GPUs on Windows):**
If you're running in WSL2 and want GPU acceleration:
1. Install NVIDIA GPU drivers on Windows (version 455.41 or later)
2. In WSL2, verify GPU is visible: `nvidia-smi`
3. Install CUDA toolkit: `conda install -c nvidia cuda-toolkit`
4. Reinstall JAX with CUDA: `pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda12]"`
5. Test GPU detection: `python -c "import jax; print(jax.devices())"`

If `nvidia-smi` fails in WSL2, you may need to update your Windows NVIDIA drivers or enable GPU virtualization in your WSL2 configuration.

### REBCO Paper Results Reproduction

To reproduce the key results from the paper, you can run the validation script. This script executes the same validation functions used in the notebooks and provides a summary of the results.

```bash
python scripts/validate_reproducibility.py
```

This will output the validation results for the baseline and high-field configurations.

**Expected Output:**
The script will print the results of the validation tests. You should expect to see output similar to the following, confirming that the simulations match the paper's results:
- Baseline: 2.1T field, 0.01% ripple, 1171A current
- High-field: 7.07T field, 0.16% ripple, 89-tape architecture
- Thermal: 74.5K margin, 150W cryocooler requirement
- Mechanical: 35 MPa reinforced stress (vs 175 MPa baseline)

**Timeline**: September 10 – October 30, 2025 for initial research phase.

## Usage Examples

### Electromagnetic Field Analysis

```python
from src.hts.coil import HTSCoil
from src.hts.materials import rebco_jc_kim_model

# Define REBCO coil parameters
coil = HTSCoil(N=400, I=1171, R=0.2, tape_width=0.004)

# Calculate magnetic field distribution
B_field = coil.magnetic_field_helmholtz(z_range=0.1)
ripple = coil.calculate_ripple(B_field)

print(f"Center field: {B_field[0]:.2f} T")
print(f"Field ripple: {ripple*100:.3f}%")
```

### Stress Analysis with Open-Source FEA

```python
from scripts.fea_integration import create_fea_interface

# Initialize open-source FEA solver
fea = create_fea_interface("fenics")

# Define coil configuration
coil_params = {
    'N': 400, 'I': 1171, 'R': 0.2,
    'tape_thickness': 0.1e-3, 'n_tapes': 20
}

# Run electromagnetic stress analysis
results = fea.run_analysis(coil_params)
print(f"Max hoop stress: {results.max_hoop_stress/1e6:.1f} MPa")
```

### Stress Analysis with COMSOL Multiphysics

```python
from scripts.fea_integration import create_fea_interface

# Initialize COMSOL solver
fea = create_fea_interface("comsol")

# Run analysis (requires COMSOL installation)
results = fea.run_analysis(coil_params)
print(f"Max hoop stress: {results.max_hoop_stress/1e6:.1f} MPa")
```

### COMSOL Plasma-EM Soliton Validation

```python
# Run as Python module (recommended)
python -m src.warp.comsol_plasma

# Run directly (may show import warnings)
cd src/warp && python comsol_plasma.py
```

The COMSOL plasma integration provides advanced plasma-electromagnetic coupling simulation with:
- Professional-grade plasma physics modeling using COMSOL's Plasma Module
- HTS field integration for toroidal magnetic confinement 
- Soliton formation analysis with Lentz metric integration
- Validation framework achieving <5% error vs analytical solutions
- Batch execution capability without GUI requirements

**Import Resolution**: The script uses comprehensive import fallback mechanisms to handle:
- Soliton integration (from `soliton_plasma.py`)
- HTS coil integration (from `src.hts.coil`) 
- COMSOL FEA components (from `src.hts.comsol_fea`)
- Warp-bubble-optimizer algorithms (from `src.warp.optimizer`)

Running as a Python module (`python -m src.warp.comsol_plasma`) ensures proper import resolution and eliminates import warnings.

### FEniCSx Plasma-EM Soliton Validation (Open-Source Alternative)

```python
# Run FEniCSx version as Python module (recommended)
python -m src.warp.fenics_plasma

# Run directly (may show import warnings)  
cd src/warp && python fenics_plasma.py
```

The FEniCSx plasma integration provides equivalent open-source functionality with:
- FEniCSx (DOLFINx) finite element plasma physics modeling
- Same HTS field integration and soliton formation analysis as COMSOL version
- Validation framework achieving <5% error vs analytical solutions
- Automated mesh generation and adaptive refinement
- No licensing requirements - fully open source

**Feature Parity**: The FEniCSx version includes all the latest features from the COMSOL version:
- Advanced plasma-electromagnetic coupling with Maxwell equations
- HTS field integration using existing coil models
- Soliton formation modeling with Lentz metric integration
- Comprehensive validation against analytical solutions
- Integration with warp-bubble-optimizer energy optimization algorithms

**Performance**: FEniCSx typically provides faster execution times than COMSOL for equivalent simulations while offering the same level of physics fidelity.

### Monte Carlo Sensitivity Analysis

```python
from scripts.sensitivity_analysis import monte_carlo_analysis

# Run 1000-sample Monte Carlo simulation
results = monte_carlo_analysis(n_samples=1000)

feasible_rate = np.mean(results['feasible'])
print(f"Design feasibility: {feasible_rate:.1%}")
print(f"Critical parameters: Jc, tape thickness")
```

### Figure Generation Process:

1. **Magnetic Field Calculation**: Uses Biot-Savart law implementation from `src/hts/coil.py` with discretized current loops
2. **Stress Analysis**: Maxwell stress tensor computation σᵢⱼ = (1/μ₀)[BᵢBⱼ - ½δᵢⱼB²] from field gradients
3. **IEEE Formatting**: 300+ DPI resolution, Times Roman fonts, colorblind-friendly palettes, proper axis labels and units

### Simulation Parameters (Realistic REBCO):
- Turns: 400 (based on 4mm tape width, 0.2mm thickness)
- Current: 1171 A (146 A/mm² current density at 77K)
- Radius: 0.2 m (practical size for laboratory demonstration)
- Field Performance: 2.11 T center field, 40.7% ripple
- Stress Limits: 415.9 MPa maximum hoop stress (exceeds 35 MPa delamination threshold)

Figures are automatically copied to `papers/figures/` for LaTeX compilation.

**Reproducibility**: Figure generation uses deterministic simulation parameters. For uncertainty quantification, run parameter sweeps documented in `docs/UQ-TODO.ndjson`.
