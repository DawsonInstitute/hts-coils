# Warp Field Coils - HTS Coils for Magnetic Confinement and Field Generation

This repository now includes an HTS (REBCO) coil design track targeting B=5–10 T fields with <0.01% ripple for plasma confinement and EM-plasma sourcing. Objectives: thermal margin >20 mK, coil energy efficiency >99%, and confinement efficiency ≥94% in Bennett-profile scenarios. See docs/roadmap.ndjson for milestones and docs/progress_log.ndjson for execution status.

Quickstart (CI-like local run):
- python scripts/generate_hts_artifacts.py  # writes artifacts/ and feasibility_gates_report.json

Reference equations: J_c = Φ0/(2√2π λ^2 ξ) (1-T/Tc)^{3/2}; ∇^μ F_{μν} = 4π J_ν; n(r)=n0(1+ξ^2 r^2)^{-2}; T_{μν}^{EM} = F_{μλ} F_ν{}^λ - 1/4 g_{μν} F^2.
