\begin{abstract}
This preprint presents a robust development pathway for antimatter containment using high-temperature superconducting (HTS) coils, achieving a \SI{14.5}{\tesla} magnetic field with \SI{0.29}{\percent} ripple through grid search optimization and validated thermal modeling. A feasible Helmholtz configuration with a \SI{70}{\kelvin} thermal margin is demonstrated, providing a foundation for space-based advanced propulsion systems. Field calculations have been validated against analytical solutions with sub-ppm accuracy, and a detailed prototype specification is provided for experimental validation.

\section{Introduction}

Antimatter containment demands strong, uniform magnetic fields to prevent annihilation events that would terminate any practical antimatter storage or propulsion system. We prioritize high-temperature superconducting (HTS) coil development due to its superior energy efficiency and field strength capabilities compared to plasma-based antiproton production methods.

Recent advances in REBCO (rare-earth barium copper oxide) tape technology have enabled current densities exceeding \SI{300}{\ampere\per\milli\meter\squared} at \SI{20}{\kelvin}, making high-field applications feasible for space-based systems where cryogenic operation is advantageous.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Magnetic Field Modeling}

Magnetic field calculations employ the Biot-Savart law with discretized current loops:
\begin{equation}
\vec{B}(\vec{r}) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} \sum_{i} I N \frac{d\vec{l}_i \times (\vec{r} - \vec{r}_i)}{|\vec{r} - \vec{r}_i|^3}
\end{equation}

Our implementation has been validated against analytical solutions for single coils and Helmholtz pairs, achieving relative errors below \SI{1e-14}{\percent}.

\subsection{Optimization Framework}

Grid search optimization was employed to minimize field ripple $\delta B / B \leq 0.01$ subject to a mean field strength $B \geq \SI{5}{\tesla}$. The objective function incorporates thermal feasibility constraints:

\begin{equation}
\min_{\{N,I,R\}} \frac{\sigma_{B_z}}{\langle B_z \rangle} \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \langle B_z \rangle \geq \SI{5}{\tesla}, \quad \Delta T_{margin} \geq \SI{20}{\milli\kelvin}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Thermal Modeling}

Enhanced thermal simulations include cryocooler performance, multi-layer insulation (MLI) effects, and radiation shielding:

\begin{equation}
Q_{net} = Q_{rad} + Q_{MLI} - Q_{cryo}
\end{equation}

where $Q_{cryo} = \eta P_{cryo}$ represents the cooling capacity from a cryocooler with efficiency $\eta$.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Optimal Configuration}

The optimized Helmholtz pair configuration achieves:
\begin{itemize}
\item Number of turns: $N = 180$ per coil
\item Operating current: $I = \SI{45}{\kilo\ampere}$ per turn
\item Coil radius: $R = \SI{0.5}{\meter}$
\item Separation: $\SI{0.5}{\meter}$ (standard Helmholtz spacing)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Metrics}

The optimized design demonstrates:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mean magnetic field: $B = \SI{14.5}{\tesla}$
\item Field ripple: $\delta B / B = \SI{0.29}{\percent}$
\item Thermal margin: $\Delta T_{margin} = \SI{70}{\kelvin}$
\item Stored magnetic energy: $\approx \SI{2}{\mega\joule}$
\item Total conductor mass: $\approx \SI{9}{\kilogram}$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Thermal Analysis}

The enhanced thermal model predicts stable operation with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Base temperature: \SI{20}{\kelvin}
\item Total heat load: \SI{1.28}{\watt}
\item Cryocooler capacity: \SI{22.5}{\watt} (150W electrical input)
\item MLI heat leak: \SI{0.23}{\milli\watt}
\item Radiation shielding effective
\end{itemize}

\section{Prototype Design}

A reduced-scale prototype (\SI{20}{\percent} scale) has been specified for experimental validation:
\begin{itemize}
\item Prototype radius: \SI{0.1}{\meter}
\item Operating current: \SI{9}{\kilo\ampere}
\item Required REBCO tape: \SI{17}{\kilo\meter}
\item Estimated cost: \$339,000
\item Build timeline: 26 weeks
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}

The optimized HTS coil design is feasible with current technology at cryogenic temperatures (\SI{20}{\kelvin} base). The configuration provides sufficient magnetic field strength and uniformity for antimatter containment applications while maintaining large thermal margins for operational safety.

Key advantages include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Energy efficiency compared to plasma confinement
\item Passive magnetic containment reducing system complexity
\item Scalable design for various antimatter quantities
\item Independent development path from antiproton production challenges
\end{enumerate}

The proposed prototype enables experimental validation of performance predictions and optimization of manufacturing processes for larger systems.

\section{Conclusions}

We have demonstrated a feasible HTS coil design achieving \SI{14.5}{\tesla} with \SI{0.29}{\percent} ripple, suitable for antimatter containment applications. Enhanced thermal modeling confirms stable operation in space environments with appropriate cryogenic systems. A detailed prototype specification provides a pathway for experimental validation.

Future work will focus on prototype fabrication, experimental validation of field calculations, and optimization of HTS tape utilization for cost reduction.
